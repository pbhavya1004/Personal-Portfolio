        Hi! I’m Bhavya Patel. I’m a third-year Honours Computer Science Co-op student at McMaster University. <br><br>
        My journey into computer science started when I began university, and while it wasn’t always easy, I’ve learned so much and grown through the challenges. Along the way, I’ve gained a mix of skills and hands-on experience from different courses. <br><br>
        Right now, I’m working on a project that combines AI with everything I’ve learned so far, and I’m really excited about where it’s taking me! <br><br>
        When I’m not focused on school, I enjoy reading — thrillers and mystery novels are my current obsession. I’m also passionate about cooking and love exploring new cuisines and experimenting with different flavours in the kitchen. These hobbies keep me creative and bring balance to my busy schedule.
